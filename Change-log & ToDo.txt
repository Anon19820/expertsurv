Changelog: 2024

Removed the dependence to Flexsurv

Have an option not to include expert_opinion currently it is cumbersome.
Double check the shiny app.
Make sure the package doesn't need rstan to run.
Correct and expand upon the priors.
Plot the density of the expert opinion on the plot.

Changelog: 2023

# Updated Stan files based on new array syntax
# Added a new vignette for the shiny application.

#CRAN version

For convience I have the CRAN submission version to Anon Github. 
Removed src;Look at Andrew Johnson comment who says that I don't actually need to upload the src to Github as it only works for my computer.

Fixed issue with Lognormal likelihood calculation
Fixed issue with flexsurvreg implmentation of spline based models.
Fixed error with norm_err_mod and other distributions. 

#To Do:
1- Fix the integrator function in flexsurv. Can often fail, can use analytical expression I used for JAGS
2 - Update with Shiny - Done






Fixed issue in compute_ICS_stan function in which if the waic function from loo package could not evaluate waic an error would result.
Implement logarithmic pooling in the model (was given as an option but not implemented previously).
Modified the model.fit.plot from survHE to allow for plotting pml, waic etc.
Changed example to highlight the weights need to sum up to 1.
Tidied up the folder structure and removed uneeded files.

#Notes to self


If you ever want to overwrite a package function this is the best way to do it.

tmpfun <- get("make_sim_hmc", envir = asNamespace("survHE"))
environment(make_sim_hmc) <- environment(tmpfun)
attributes(make_sim_hmc) <- attributes(tmpfun)  
assignInNamespace("make_sim_hmc", make_sim_hmc, ns="survHE")


To add something to the build ignore use this code usethis::use_build_ignore(c("man-roxygen"))
same for gitignore  usethis::use_git_ignore(c("src"))
if the stan files cause an error on recompilation, delete all the src files, the config files and run rstantools::use_stan()

To stop the issue with big pdfs you have to isnstall qpdf and then set the path variable

old_path <- Sys.getenv("PATH")
Sys.setenv(PATH = paste( "C:\\Program Files\\qpdf 11.2.0\\bin",old_path, sep = ";"))
Sys.getenv()

Check location of files

pathway <- "C:/Users/phili/OneDrive/PhD/R_packages/expertsurv/"
myfiles <- list.files(paste0(pathway, "R"), full.names = TRUE)
check_text <- c("scales")
Filter(function(file) any(grepl(paste0(check_text, collapse = "|"), readLines(file, warn = FALSE))),
       myfiles)

#Submit to CRAN
Create Tarball
devtools::build() #Will create the tarball
R --vanilla CMD check C:/Users/phili/OneDrive/PhD/R_packages/expertsurv_1.0.0.tar.gz



#Future Updates
Need to update the ``expert_pooling`` function`to allow for integration with the SHINY app.
Need to remove attach
